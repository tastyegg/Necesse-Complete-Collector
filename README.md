# Necesse Complete Collector Character Save
This is a character save with items for achieving the Complete Collector.

# How to Use:
1. Insert the `Collector.dat` save file into `%appdata%\..\Roaming\Necesse\saves\characters`.
2. Load/Create a world, and then select the `Collector` character.
3. It'll discover 1834 items for the achievement.

# The What?
Entering a world with this character may acquire the achievement, given if the item list is still the same as the v1.0 release; however, this is considerable unlikely given the update roadmap. If and when there is an update, this character will load up 1834 items; so, most of the tedious stuff is already done (i.e. the Landscaping items or the Cosmetics).

There are 2028 items in their Void Storage. This is marked by the save file's CLOUD item array. The game itself saved those 2028 valid items, but only 1834 of them are valid for the collection. Most of them were found in the game's en.lang file. But, some are generated by name in-game or appended with a number, like "cryptgravestone2" and "copperoredeepsandstonerock".
What's interesting is that the Void Bag is only 40 slots. But, it doesn't shrink the array down, unlike the main 50-slot inventory. Obviously, opening a Void Bag only shows the first 40 items. The items existing in the overflow just magically count towards the achievement, even when the character doesn't have a Void Punch/Bag.
